    <h3>Quotes from Coders</h3>
    
    <ul>

      <li>"The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed
      from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from
	air, creating by exertion of the imagination." &mdash; Fred
      Brooks </li>
      
      <li>"A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with
      traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical
      concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to
	convince a reader that the results will be correct." &mdash; Donald
      Knuth</li>

      <li>"A human must turn information into intelligence or
      knowledge. We've tended to forget that no computer will ever ask
	a new question. &mdash; Grace Hopper</li>
      
    </ul>
