    <h3>Quotes from Coders</h3>
    <blockquote>"The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed
      from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from
      air, creating by exertion of the imagination." <b> &mdash; Fred Brooks</b></blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>"A human must turn information into intelligence or
	knowledge. We've tended to forget that no computer will ever ask
	a new question." <strong>&mdash; Grace Hopper</strong></blockquote>
