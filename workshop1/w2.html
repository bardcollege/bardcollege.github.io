    <h3>Quotes from Coders</h3>
    
    <blockquote>
      "The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from
      pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air,
      creating by exertion of the imagination."  &mdash; <a href =
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks">Fred Brooks</a>
    </blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>
      "A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional
      aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts,
      to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince a
      reader that the results will be correct." &mdash; <a href =
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      "A human must turn information into intelligence or
      knowledge. We've tended to forget that no computer will ever ask
      a new question." &mdash; <a href =
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Quotes from Linguists</h3>

    <blockquote>
      "Language disguises thought."
      &mdash; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>
    </blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>
      "Language is a process of free creation; its laws and principles
      are fixed, but the manner in which the principles of generation
      are used is free and infinitely varied. Even the interpretation
      and use of words involves a process of free creation."
      &mdash; <a href =
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>
    </blockquote>
    
    
    <blockquote>
      "Journalists say that when a dog bites a man, that is not new,
      but when a man bites a dog that is news.  This is the essence of
      the langauge instinct: language conveys news."  &mdash;
      <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Steven Pinker</a>
