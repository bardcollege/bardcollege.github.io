    <h3>Quotes from Coders</h3>
    <blockquote>"The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed
      from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from
      air, creating by exertion of the imagination." <b> &mdash; Fred Brooks</b></blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>"A human must turn information into intelligence or
	knowledge. We've tended to forget that no computer will ever ask
	a new question." <strong>&mdash; Grace Hopper</strong></blockquote>
    
    <h3>DECODING Language: <a href="https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/ikos/EXFAC03-AAS/h05/larestoff/linguistics/Chapter%201.(H05).pdf">What is language?</a></h3>


    <ul>
      <li>A means for human communication
      <li>A system linking arbitrary forms to meanings
      <li>A means to create infinite meaningful expressions via syntax
    </ul>


    <h3>Quotes from Linguists</h3>

    <blockquote>"Language disguises thought."
      <b> &mdash;Ludwig Wittgenstein</b>
    </blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>"Language is a process of free creation; its laws and
    principles are fixed, but the manner in which the principles of
    generation are used is free and infinitely varied. Even the
    interpretation and use of words involves a process of free
    creation. "
      <b> &mdash;Noam Chomsky</b>
    </blockquote>
    

    
    <blockquote>"Journalists say that when a dog bits a man, that is
    not new, but when a man bits a dog that is news.  This is the
    essence of the langauge instinct: language conveys news."
      <b> &mdash;Steven Pinker</b>
    </blockquote>
