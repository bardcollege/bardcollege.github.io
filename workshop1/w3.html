    <h3>Quotes from Coders</h3>

    <blockquote>
        "<span class = "redacted">The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed
        from pure </span> thought-stuff<span class = "redacted">. He </span>builds <span class = "redacted">his castles in the air, from
        air, creating</span> by exertion<span class = "redacted">of the imagination</span>."<b>&mdash;  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks">Fred Brooks</a></b>
    </blockquote>

          
    <blockquote>"A programmer is ideally an <u>essayist</u> who works with
      traditional <u>aesthetic</u> and <u>literary</u> forms as well as mathematical
      concepts, to <u>communicate</u> the way that an algorithm works and to
      convince a <u>reader</u> that the results will be correct." <i>&mdash; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a></i></blockquote>

    <blockquote>"A human must turn information into intelligence or
      knowledge. We've tended to forget that no computer will ever ask
      a new question." <b>&mdash; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a></b></blockquote>

    
      <blockquote>"The <a href =
      "https://www.fourmilab.ch/babbage/sketch.html">Analytical Engine</a>
      has no pretensions whatever to <i>originate</i> anything. It can
      do whatever we <i>know how to order it</i> to perform. It
      can <i>follow</i> analysis; but it has no power of
      <i>anticipating</i> any analytical relations or truths. Its province is
      to assist us to making <i>available</i> what we are already acquainted
      with." <b>&mdash;
	  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a></b></blockquote>
