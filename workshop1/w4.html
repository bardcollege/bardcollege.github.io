      "The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from
       pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air,
       creating by exertion of the imagination."
    </blockquote>

      "A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional
       aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts,
       to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince
       a reader that the results will be correct."

      "A human must turn information into intelligence or
       knowledge. We've tended to forget that no computer will ever
       ask a new question."
