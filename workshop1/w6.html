      <h2>I Ching: The Essential Translation of the Ancient Chinese Oracle and Book of Wisdom (2014)</h2>
    
    <blockquote>
      "The <a href =
      "http://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/reading/free-online-i-ching/"> <i>I
      Ching</i></a> is a game, a most demanding game. One does not
      just read it, one does not just translate it. One plays it, one
      plays with it, one interacts with it. It plays too, in deadly
      earnest"
    </blockquote>
    
    <blockquote>
      "The act of reading creates a new dynamic, triggering
      reflections and conversations that might otherwise never take
      place."
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      "There are many methods available online that simulate the
      yarrow Stalk Method or the Coin Method. I personally do not
      recommend them, since they introduce an element into the process
      which discourages a thoughtful and calm attitude."
      <br><br><i>&mdash; John MINFORD</i>
