Code and Language
===================================

Readings and computational materials are organized by theme, though many different combinations beyond those suggested here are possible.

Themes
------

-   **Code as Language**

    Language seems to be one means to encode thought; the same can be said for computer programs. However, explaining language and its relation to codes and coding remains elusive. Can we view coding as translation from thought to language? Must you understand to translate?

    "Languaging". *Teaching as Subversive Activity*. Postman and Weingartner. pp. 98--108. </dd>

    Language and code as tools for thought, exploration, and experimentation.
    *Computer Power and Human Reason*. Weizenbaum. pp. 107 -- 110. W.H. Freeman and Company. 1976.

    Can you translate "slithy toves" to French?  
    *Goedel, Escher, Bach*. Hofstadter. pp. 372 -- 383. Basic books. 1979.

-   **Code Acts**

    Both language and code react to and act on their context. However, do they have the same status as tools of thought?

    Source Code, Libraries and Free Software
    "Source Code". Krysa and Sedek. pp. 236--242. Software Studies: A
    Lexicon. Edited by Fuller. MIT Press. 2008.

    Sentences, whether in code or language, often have truth values. However, language and code are more often used to do something --- to act.

-   **Code and Creativity**

    How do codes help us create? How is language generated by machine different from the creative process? Can it generate new ideas in the reader?

    Creative copying in the digital age?
